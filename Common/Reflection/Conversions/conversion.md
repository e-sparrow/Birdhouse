# Conversion
This namespace classes used to convert types between themselves, sometimes with possibility to do it both ways (see `Routine` folder).

**Why not do it the standard way?**

- You can to convert types your custom specified way
- You can so easy and comfortable make extensions type for your case like it made in `ColorExtensions` 
- You can create simple detect methods or constructors can be used to do your conversion just specifying two types - source and destination types
